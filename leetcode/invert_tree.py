Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

Output:

     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

    Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if root is None:
            return root
        stack = []
        stack.append(root)
        while len(stack) > 0:
            node = stack.pop()
            if node is None:
                continue
            
            node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left
            
            stack.append(node.left)
            stack.append(node.right)
        return root
