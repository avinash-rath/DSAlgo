/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] c) {
        // if(c.length==1) return c[0] >0 ? 1 : 0;
        int ans = 0;
        Arrays.sort(c);
        // System.out.println(Arrays.toString(c));
        for(int i=0; i<c.length; i++) {
            ans = c.length-i <= c[i] ? Math.max(c.length-i,ans) : ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
