'''
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(len(s) // 2):
            s[i],s[-1-i] = s[-1-i],s[i]
